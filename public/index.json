[{"content":"During my journey through the fascinating Artificial Intelligence world, I have learned, read and discovered several things, studying a lot and meeting amazing people. I have wondered several times to open a blog and share my notes and thoughs, but honestly I think it is not anymore that worth it. Nowadays blogs, posts and newsletters are everywhere so I think I would just raise the entropy level rather than be really helpful to someone. Nonetherless, I have tons of resources gathered during the years that I may like to share, write about and catalog.\nI honestly don\u0026rsquo;t have a plan but (occasionally, with not schedule, reminders, spam, subscriptions or whatsoever) I will upload in this space of mine \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; which will include thoughs, rather than \u0026ldquo;guides\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo;, taken notes, rather than curated blog posts, and lists of resources I use on a daily base.\nVivere lento, is the way 🐌\n","permalink":"https://andreagemelli.github.io/posts/hello-world/","summary":"During my journey through the fascinating Artificial Intelligence world, I have learned, read and discovered several things, studying a lot and meeting amazing people.

During my Master\u0026rsquo;s studies, I participated in two Erasmus programs, one at Ghent University in Belgium and another at the University of La Rochelle\u0026rsquo;s L3i research group. During my studies, I also gained industry experience as a data scientist at Alias2k, developing AI solutions to enhance the company\u0026rsquo;s products.\nI began a PhD in Artificial Inteligence at the University of Florence in November 2020, focusing on Document Image Analysis and Recognition, Graph Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing. During this journey, I spent a year as a visiting researcher at the Computer Vision Center, Barcelona. I published several research papers in international conferences, journals and workshops, also attending ICVSS 2023 and Cambridge ELLIS 2022 summer schools. I also taught theory and programming courses at the universities of Florence and Arezzo and supervised students on their projects and theses. In 2023 I was also entitled as IAPR International Scholar.\nAfter succesfully concluded my PhD with the Doctor Europaeus title, I joined LetXBe, a Paris-based startup focused in Document Analysis and NLP, in December 2023. In my current role, I am creating innovative LLM-based and multi-modal solutions for both research purposes and client requirements. I am also actively contributing to product development thorugh code reviewes and PRs and leading a monthly internal reading group to foster technical team knowledge sharing and collaboration.\nTechnologies 🤖 Machine Learning Transormers, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Weights \u0026amp; Bias\n☁️ Cloud AWS, Docker, Github\n🔭 Not-ML Angular, Latex\nPlaces \u0026amp; Languages 📍 Lived in: Figline V.no \u0026amp; Montevarchi (🇮🇹) until 2023 Florence (🇮🇹) in 2021 Ghent (🇧🇪) from 2018 to 2019 La Rochelle (🇫🇷) in 2020 Barcelona (🇪🇸) from 2022 to 2023 Paris (🇫🇷) from 2024 🗣️ Speaking: Italian 🤌🏻 English (C1) Spanish (Fluent) French 🥖 ","permalink":"https://andreagemelli.github.io/about/","summary":"about me","title":"Career"},{"content":"📣 Conference Proceedings Structure Matters: Analyzing Videos Via Graph Neural Networks for Social Media Platform Attribution\nAndrea Gemelli, Dasara Shullani, Daniele Baracchi, Simone Marinai, Alessandro Piva\nInternational Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2024\nDeep-learning for dysgraphia detection in children handwritings\nAndrea Gemelli, Simone Marinai, Emanuele Vivoli, Tamara Zappaterra\nDocument Engineering (DocEng), 2023\nCTE: A Dataset for Contextualized Table Extraction\nAndrea Gemelli, Emanuele Vivoli, Simone Marinai\nItalian Research Conference on Digital Libraries (IRCDL), 2023\nDoc2Graph: A Task Agnostic Document Understanding Framework Based on Graph Neural Networks\nAndrea Gemelli, Sanket Biswas, Enrico Civitelli, Josep Lladós, Simone Marinai\nEuropean Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) @ TiE Workshop, 2022\nGraph Neural Networks and Representation Embedding for Table Extraction in PDF Documents\nAndrea Gemelli, Emanuele Vivoli, Simone Marinai\nInternational Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2022\nData Augmentation on Graphs for Table Type Classification\nDavide Del Bimbo, Andrea Gemelli, Simone Marinai\nS+SSPR, 2022\n📜 Journal Papers Datasets and annotations for layout analysis of scientific articles\nAndrea Gemelli, Simone Marinai, Lorenzo Pisaneschi, Francesco Santoni\nInternational Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), 2024\nAutomatic generation of scientific papers for data augmentation in document layout analysis\nLorenzo Pisaneschi, Andrea Gemelli, Simone Marinai\nPattern Recognition Letters, 2023\n📔 PhD Thesis Connecting the DOCS: a graph-based approach to document understanding\nAndrea Gemelli, 2024\n","permalink":"https://andreagemelli.github.io/publications/","summary":"search","title":"Publications"}]
