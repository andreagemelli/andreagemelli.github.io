I pursued a **Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Florence**, graduating with full marks in October 2020. During my Master's studies, I participated in two Erasmus programs, one at **Ghent University** in Belgium and another at the **University of La Rochelle**'s L3i research group. During my studies, I also gained industry experience as a data scientist at [Alias2k](https://alias2k.com/en/about-us/), developing AI solutions to enhance the company's products.

I began a [PhD in Artificial Intelligence](https://smartcomputing.unifi.it) at the University of Florence in November 2020, focusing on Document Image Analysis and Recognition, Graph Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing. During this journey, I spent a year as a visiting researcher at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es), Barcelona. I published several research papers in international conferences, journals and workshops (ECCV, ICASSP, IJDAR, PRL), and also attended [ICVSS 2023](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss2023/Home) and [Cambridge ELLIS 2022](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/summer-school-23/) summer schools. I also taught theory and programming courses at the universities of Florence and Arezzo and supervised students on their projects and theses. In 2023, I was also entitled as **IAPR International Scholar**.

After successfully concluding my PhD with the **Doctor Europaeus** title, I joined [LetXBe](https://www.letxbe.ai), a Paris-based startup focused on Document Analysis and NLP, in December 2023. In my current role, I am creating innovative LLM-based and multi-modal solutions for research purposes and client requirements. I am also actively contributing to product development through code reviews and PRs and leading a monthly internal reading group to foster technical team knowledge sharing and collaboration.
