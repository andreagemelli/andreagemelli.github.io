During my journey through the fascinating artificial intelligence world, I have learned, read, and discovered several things, studied a lot, and met amazing people. I have wondered several times about opening a blog and sharing my notes and thoughts. I have tons of resources gathered during the years that I may like to write about and catalogue.

I honestly don’t have a plan but (occasionally, with no schedule, reminders, spam, subscriptions or whatsoever) I will upload in this space of mine *things* which will include thoughts, rather than “guides” or “how to”, taken notes, rather than curated blog posts, and lists of resources I use on a daily base.
